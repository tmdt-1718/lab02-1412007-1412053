# Simple Dockerization Rails Application Sample
In this repository, I create a simple rails and docker setup. Feel free to customize it for your needs.

## Required Software
- [x] Docker
- [x] Docker Compose

## Installation
- Clone the repository.
- Run `docker-compose up`
- Access your application with the URL: http://localhost:3000

## Configuration
All of the configuration is in the .env file. If you use this file in your real application, do not commit it to your project and create a .env.sample for your team members.
